          <h2>Family Chiropractic Care</h2>
          <p>
            Chiropractic care is a core piece of fitness and health at every age. From the newborn to grandma
            and grandpa, many health issues can be resolved by restoring the body’s communication. Our
            bodies were designed to heal themselves, but if the brain can’t communicate with the body it
            inhibits proper healing.
          </p>
          <h2>Infant care</h2>
          <p>No baby is too small for an adjustment. Often, newborns can benefit the most from chiropractic
            adjustment. After the sometimes traumatic and aggressive process of birth, it is very common for
            infants to be out of alignment. This can lead to colic, general fussiness, poor digestion, weakened
            immune system, and difficulty sleeping, among other issues. While some people may worry that
            chiropractic adjustment is dangerous at such a young age, the opposite is actually true. Newborns
            with untreated spinal issues face a higher risk of SIDS. Chiropractic adjustments on infants are
            much gentler and easier than adult adjustments. That is because newborns are already very
            flexible and their bones move easily. Often, a newborn adjustment looks more like a gentle
            massage than the popping and twisting of an adult adjustment. </p>
            <h2>Pediatric and Adolescent Care</h2>
            <p>A short browse of YouTube will confirm for you that the fact that most children survive to
                adulthood is something of a miracle. Children are often launching themselves off things, running
                at full tilt, twisting their bodies in wild dance or gymnastics. Many children and teens today also
                play in recreational sports, with increasing intensity and competition. All of this movement is great
                for their bodies, but also increases their chances of injuring themselves. Children and teens are
                just as vulnerable to health complications from spinal issues as adults. It is beneficial to take your
                children for regular adjustments to keep them from injury and help their bodies grow properly. This
                can also help them create healthy lifelong habits</p>
             <h2>Adult Care</h2> 
             <p>Whether you sit at a desk all day, perform manual labor or chase after small children, the
                repetitive tasks in our days eventually lead to spinal subluxations. Untreated subluxations can
                cause a ripple of destruction to your health. Pain, headaches, dizziness, low energy, difficulty
                sleeping, weakened immune health are all symptoms of subluxation. Regardless of your activity
                level, you should check in with a Chiropractor regularly to address issues while they are small.
                Consistent care is better than allowing your pain to finally bring you into the office. Once you are
                in pain your back has already been struggling for awhile and it takes longer and more adjustments
                to get it healthy again. </p>  
            <h2>Elderly Care</h2>
            <p>As we become older, our bones become more brittle and our muscles lose flexibility. Also, many
                adults’ activity level decrease as they age. With these changes, it is essential to continue to care
                for our spinal health to steward overall health. Chiropractors can help maximize range of motion
                and address the stiffness of aging muscles. Regular Chiropractic care can also help reduce the
                severity of arthritis. Maintaining spinal health leads to a more full and pain-free life, even into the
                sunset years of your life.
